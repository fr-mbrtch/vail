9.5    Bargained For Allocation of Risk.

10.    **Indemnification.**  Licensee will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tableau and its Representatives from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, injuries, harm, expense, expenditure and disbursement of every nature (including, without limitation, costs of investigation, travel expenses, and value of time expended by personnel), fines, fees, costs, and expenses of litigation, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees incident to any of the foregoing (collectively, “Losses”) arising from or related to (a) Licensee’s use of the Software; (b) the acts or omissions of Licensee, its Representatives, its Authorized Users, any other Person whom Licensee or its Representatives provides with access to the Software; and (c) Licensee’s breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

11.    **General**

11.1    Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the full understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, supersedes and replaces all prior understandings and writings related to such subject matter.

11.2    Waiver.  No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the waiving party. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

11.3    Equitable Remedies.  The parties agree that any material breach of this Agreement by either party or its directors, officers, employees, students, affiliates, agents, advisers, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, or other representatives may cause immediate and irreparable harm, for which monetary damages would be inadequate or difficult to ascertain.  The parties therefore agree that, upon the existence of any such breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching party may immediately seek a temporary restraining order or other appropriate form of equitable relief, without posting a bond or other form of security.  This paragraph will not limit either party’s rights to obtain monetary damages in addition to or as substitution for such equitable relief.

11.4    Governing Law; Venue.  This Agreement and all matters related thereto will be construed and interpreted under and governed by the laws of the State of Washington and the federal laws of the United States of America, in each case excluding their conflicts of laws provisions, and not under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods.  Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement (including any agreements or documents incorporated herein by reference), or the breach thereof shall be brought in the state or federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, and the parties hereby waive any claim or defense that such forum is not convenient or proper.  Each party hereby agrees that any such court shall have personal jurisdiction over it and consents to service of process in any manner authorized by Washington law.

11.5    Attorneys’ Fees. In the event that any action, suit, arbitration, or other legal or administrative proceeding is instituted or commenced by either party hereto against the other party arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs from the non-prevailing party.

11.6    Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any term of this Agreement in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms or the validity or enforceability of such term in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.  If a final judgment declares any term hereof to be invalid or unenforceable, the court making the determination shall have the power to limit the term, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace it with a term that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of replaced term, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.  In the event that such court declines to modify such provisions, then the parties will in good faith negotiate a modification to the provision to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable in conformity with the parties’ intent as manifested herein.
